# SuperFastMode
Mod for Slay the Spire that speeds up the Game

This is done by making the game think more time has elapsed than actually has.
Also, SuperFastMode tries to only speed up Animations and Actions that are a bottleneck to the games speed.
This means that you can still enjoy most Monster and Player Animations at normal speed, while the actual gameplay is lightning fast.
